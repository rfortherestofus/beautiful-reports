Start with story of how Mal recognized PDF template

Two extremes: 

- Highly produced docs made by graphic designer
- Ugly reports made in R

R users are not graphic designers

# PSC

Story of how they came to me (the horror of generating 170 reports)

HTML is great, but many people still want something they can read so they need PDFs

pagedown is great because it's not LaTeX!

Thomas and I produce highly stylized, but custom templates with pagedown

- Show PSC + OMNI

Problem is you need to know HTML + CSS well to really work with pagedown

- Talk about my office hours session trying to show how to customize a few things

How can we make something that other R users can adapt and use? 

# pagedreport

All customization in YAML

Demo one template

# Conclusion

Don't do ugly PDFs

Use pagedreport
